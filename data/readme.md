# Data 

The data used in this project cannot be shared with third-parties and is thus not available in this repository. The file `example_dataset.csv` shows how the data is structured and provides one manually created example.

The annotated data contains customer feedback from the banking domain in Dutch and English as well as several customer experience scores - a more detailed description of the data can be found in *Chapter 3 - Methodology* of the [Thesis](https://github.com/cltl-students/Weber_Elena_Automatic_Topic_Classification/blob/main/Weber_Elena_MA_Thesis.pdf). For the project, only the columns *CsatTopicEn* and *Sentence_new_improved* play a part. The former being the class of the latter, the feedback statement.
