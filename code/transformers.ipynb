    "## Info\n",
    "This notebook is designed to use a pretrained BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT model and fine-tune it on an Automatic Topic Classification task. All the instructions on the setups used can be found on \"*Chapter 3: Methodology* \" of the thesis report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is using the [AutoClasses](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/auto.html) from \n",
    "[transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) functionality. \n",
    "This functionality can guess a model's configuration, tokenizer and architecture just by passing in the model's name. This allows us to reuse the code on a large number of transformers models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook? \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was built with reusability in mind. The way I load the dataset into the PyTorch class is pretty standard and can be easily reused for any other dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only modifications needed to use your own dataset will be in reading in the dataset inside the PyTorch **Dataset** class under **Dataset and DataLoader** tab. The **DataLoader** will return a dictionary of batch inputs format so that it can be fed straight to the model using the statement: `outputs = model(**batch)`. *As long as this statement holds, the rest of the code will work.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic parameters are defined under the **Imports** tab:\n",
    "* `epochs` - will be used as the number of epochs to train the model. \n",
    "* `batch_size` - will be used as the batch size during training. The larger the batch the more RAM / GPU memory it will take. \n",
    "* `max_length` - I use this variable if I want to truncate text inputs to a shorter length than the maximum allowed word piece tokens sequence length. The shorter the sequence the faster it will train.\n",
    "* `model_name_or_path` - This is where I put the transformer model I want to train. In this work, I used `bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased`, and `roberta-base`.\n",
    "* `labels_ids` - It is mostly the case that labels have a name / meaning. We need to associate each name / meaning with a number / id. I use this variable to create a dictionary that maps labels names to ids. This will be used later inside the PyTorch Dataset class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "This notebook will cover the fine-tuning of transfromer-based models on Automatic Topic Classification. The Dataset used for this finetuning step is the annotated customer feedback set from tha Banking Domain. "
